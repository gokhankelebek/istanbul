## 1. What Is a Greek Gyro?

A Greek gyro (pronounced **YEER-oh**) is street-food perfection: layers of seasoned meat slow-roasted on a vertical spit, shaved thin, then wrapped in warm pita with veggies and tzatziki.

## 2. How Is Gyro Meat Cooked?

- **Vertical Rotisserie:** Meat stacks rotate before a heat source.  
- **Crisp Edges, Juicy Core:** Fat drips away, outer layers caramelize, then sliced.

## 3. Key Ingredients

- **Meat:** Lamb, beef, or chickenâ€”seasoned with oregano, thyme & garlic.  
- **Pita:** Soft, pillowy, lightly toasted.  
- **Veggies:** Onions & tomatoes for crunch & freshness.  
- **Tzatziki:** Yogurt, cucumber, garlic & dill for a tangy finish.

## 4. Is It Healthy?

- **Lean Cooking:** Excess fat drains off.  
- **Protein-Rich:** Lamb & beef provide iron & zinc.  
- **Probiotic Boost:** Tzatzikiâ€™s yogurt base adds gut-friendly cultures.
