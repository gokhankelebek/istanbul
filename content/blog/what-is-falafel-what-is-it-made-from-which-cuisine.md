# What is Falafel? What is it Made From? Which Cuisine?

Falafel is one of the most recognizable dishes in Middle Eastern cuisine, beloved by vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. But what exactly is this crispy, flavorful delight, and where does it come from?

## What is Falafel?

Falafel consists of deep-fried balls or patties made from ground chickpeas, fava beans, or a combination of both. These protein-packed morsels are seasoned with herbs and spices, creating a crispy exterior and tender, flavorful interior.

## What is Falafel Made From?

### Core Ingredients:
- **Chickpeas or fava beans** (dried, not canned)
- **Fresh herbs** like parsley, cilantro, and dill
- **Aromatics** such as onions and garlic
- **Spices** including cumin, coriander, and sometimes cayenne pepper

### The Process:
1. **Soaking**: Dried legumes are soaked overnight
2. **Grinding**: The mixture is ground to the right consistency
3. **Seasoning**: Herbs and spices are mixed in
4. **Forming**: Shaped into balls or patties
5. **Frying**: Deep-fried until golden and crispy

## Which Cuisine Does Falafel Belong To?
