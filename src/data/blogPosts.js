[Read the Smithsonian article](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/the-sticky-history-of-baklava-180982771/)

Baklava – the flaky layered pastry dessert filled with nuts and sweetened with syrup or honey – is one of the most beloved Middle Eastern desserts, with a rich history spanning millennia. In every bite of its crispy, syrup-soaked layers, one can taste echoes of ancient palaces, bustling bazaars, and family kitchens. Many countries proudly claim this indulgent treat, and food lovers often wonder about the history of baklava and where baklava originated. The truth is as layered as baklava itself: from Mesopotamian ovens and Persian courts to Greek and Roman banquets, and finally to the Ottoman sultans who perfected it. Join us on a narrative journey through the origins of baklava – a tale that winds through empires and eras, leading to the Turkish baklava we know and love today.

## Where Did Baklava Originate? Ancient Roots in Mesopotamia & Antiquity
Baklava’s story begins in the ancient world. Food historians trace baklava’s origins back to around the 8th century BCE in Mesopotamia, the cradle of civilization. It’s believed that Assyrian cooks were the first to stack thin layers of unleavened flatbread with crushed nuts and honey, then bake it in wood-fired ovens as a special treat for the wealthy. This primitive version – a honey-soaked, nut-filled pastry – was a predecessor of what would later evolve into baklava. Centuries later, the idea of layering dough with decadent fillings appeared in the ancient Greek and Roman world. The Roman “placenta cake,” described by Cato in the 2nd century BCE, was made of alternating layers of dough, cheese, and honey, flavored with bay leaves and baked – remarkably similar to a proto-baklava. In fact, the Latin placenta dessert likely originated from the Greek plakous (meaning flat layered bread), and some scholars even find references to a baklava-like sweet in Homer’s Odyssey. The Greeks, renowned seafarers and traders, encountered these delights abroad and brought them home. They pioneered the technique of rolling dough “as thin as a leaf” – calling it phyllo, the Greek word for “leaf” – which was a game-changer for pastry making. Unlike the denser breads of the Assyrians, Greek bakers made dough paper-thin and delicate, creating a crispier, flaky texture. By the era of Alexander and the early Roman Empire, layered honey-nut pastries were gracing the tables of the elite across the Mediterranean, setting the stage for the baklava to come.

## Persian and Arab Influences in the Medieval Era
As centuries passed, the sweet tradition of layered pastries migrated east and west along trade routes. The Persian Empire (Iran) and the emerging Arab civilizations of the Middle East added their own ingredients and flair to the concept. Early medieval Islamic cookbooks don’t mention “baklava” by name, but they describe similar confections. For example, a 10th-century Arabic cookbook from Baghdad includes lauzinaj – delicate pastry filled with crushed almonds (forming a paste) and soaked in syrup, “as thin as grasshoppers’ wings,” according to the text. Some food historians suggest lauzinaj was an ancestor of baklava, though it was more like today’s nut-filled candy. By the 13th century, recipes for lauzinaj (originating in Persian-influenced kitchens) still appeared in Middle Eastern cookbooks. Over time, Middle Eastern pastry makers began layering these wafer-thin dough sheets with nuts, rather than simply wrapping a filling, bringing the dessert closer to the layered baklava we recognize. The medieval Persians and Arabs also introduced new flavors that would become hallmarks of baklava. Cane sugar, which became more available in the Islamic Golden Age, began to supplement or replace honey as a sweetener. Cooks in the Middle East infused their sweet syrups with fragrant rosewater and orange blossom water, and spiced them with a touch of cardamom or other spices. Meanwhile, in the eastern Mediterranean, Byzantine Greeks and neighboring peoples preserved the ancient love of nuts and honey: one Byzantine Greek treat called gastris was a sticky dessert of nuts and sesame in honey – not unlike baklava’s filling (though without the pastry layers). As Arab and Persian influences spread, we see the pastry evolving: by the Middle Ages, layered nut desserts were enjoyed from the Caucasus to Arabia. These sweet innovations – flaky dough technique from the Greeks, perfumed syrups from the Persians and Arabs, and spice from the trade routes – all merged to enrich the baklava’s recipe.

## Ottoman Empire: Baklava in the Imperial Kitchens
It was in the Ottoman Empire that baklava truly blossomed into the form we cherish today. By the 15th century, the Ottoman Turks had established a vast empire spanning Southeast Europe, Anatolia, the Middle East, and beyond. In the cosmopolitan kitchens of the Topkapı Palace in Constantinople (modern Istanbul), Ottoman chefs synthesized centuries of regional influences and perfected the art of baklava-making. The earliest known written reference to “baklava” by name comes from this period – a poem by the Sufi mystic Kaygusuz Abdal in the early 15th century, suggesting the term and the dessert were by then part of Ottoman culture. Ottoman palace cooks were true artisans: they rolled dough so thin you could practically read through it, layering dozens of these phyllo sheets with melted butter and finely chopped nuts. Court records and historians indicate that baklava as we know it was likely developed and refined in the imperial kitchens, to impress the sultans. By the 17th century, the recipe had been “perfected” under the watchful eye of the sultans, who had the resources to allocate the finest ingredients and talent to this pursuit. Baklava was no everyday sweet – it was a symbol of luxury and royal pride, reserved for special occasions and honored guests. One famous tradition underscoring baklava’s lofty status was the Baklava Alayı, or Baklava Procession, inaugurated during the reign of Sultan Süleyman the Magnificent in the 16th century. Each year on the 15th day of Ramadan, the Sultan’s chefs would bake vast quantities of baklava in the palace. The Sultan then presented trays of this prized pastry to the elite Janissary soldiers in a grand ceremony. According to historical accounts, hundreds of trays – one for every ten soldiers – were paraded from the palace kitchens in a spectacular display. The Janissaries would march the trays back to their barracks in a festive procession, savoring the gift before returning the empty brass trays the next day. This ritual, known as the “baklava procession,” was a highly anticipated event, reinforcing baklava’s image as a near-sacred delicacy in Ottoman dessert history. Not only Muslims, but peoples of all faiths within the Ottoman realm embraced baklava. Ottoman Christians, for instance, made baklava for Lent – some using 40 layers of phyllo to represent the 40 days of fasting, or 33 layers to honor the years of Christ’s life. Jewish communities in the empire served baklava on holidays like Purim, integrating it into their festivities. In an empire spanning many cultures, baklava became a unifying treat – a dessert of empire and celebration. Crucially, as the Ottoman Empire expanded, it became a conduit that spread baklava far and wide. The Ottoman practice of recruiting the best cooks from across their domains led to a standardization of baklava recipes. By the 18th and 19th centuries, baklava was not only an indulgence of the royal court but had trickled down to the masses. Confectionery shops in Constantinople and other Ottoman cities began selling baklava to the middle class, making it more accessible (though still a luxury at the time). Ottoman travelers, administrators, and traders took their love of baklava to distant provinces and trade partners. By the empire’s zenith, baklava had become a staple across Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cultures, from North Africa to the Balkans and Central Asia. Each region would soon put its own twist on the recipe, but the Ottoman Turkish influence in defining modern baklava is unmistakable. It’s telling that even today, baklava is often identified with Turkey – a testament to the Ottoman role in elevating this dessert to culinary fame.

## Regional Variations: One Baklava, Many Traditions
Thanks to its journey through so many lands, baklava today comes in delightful regional variants. The core idea remains: flaky layered pastry, ground nuts, and a sticky sweet syrup. Yet, each culture’s baklava has a slightly different character, shaped by local ingredients and tastes. Many of these differences center on the choice of nuts and sweeteners. Turkish baklava (the kind that originated in the Ottoman heartland) traditionally uses pistachios or walnuts as the filling, depending on the region of Turkey. The syrup is usually a simple sugar syrup with a hint of lemon – never honey, according to purists – which lets the flavor of the butter and nuts shine. In the famed Turkish baklava of Gaziantep, for example, bright green pistachios are the star, and the pastry is so crisp and light that it shatters at first bite. By contrast, Greek baklava is often made with walnuts (sometimes almonds, especially in southern Greece) and warmly spiced with cinnamon. Greek recipes frequently combine honey with sugar for the syrup, along with a splash of citrus, so Greek baklava tends to have a distinct honeyed fragrance. In Greece, one often encounters baklava drenched in honey syrup and cut into large, hearty squares. Tradition holds that Greek baklava is made with 33 layers of phyllo to symbolize the years of Christ’s life, reflecting how the dessert took on meaning in Greek Orthodox communities. In the Arab countries of the Levant – Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and their neighbors – baklava (often spelled baklawa) has its own nuances. Levantine baklava usually features walnuts or pistachios as well, but the syrup is perfumed with orange blossom or rosewater, giving it a floral aroma. It’s typically less overtly sweet than some Turkish or Greek versions, using a lighter hand with the syrup so that the pastry’s crunch is retained. One might notice Levantine baklava pieces are often smaller and more delicate, sometimes in diamond cuts or rolled into cigar shapes. This way, one can indulge in a few pieces without being overwhelmed – perfect alongside strong Arabic coffee. Persian baklava (for example in Iran) can be quite distinctive. Iranian baklava, such as the famous styles from Yazd or Qazvin, often uses a mix of almonds and pistachios and is flavored with cardamom and saffron, which are cherished spices in Persian cuisine. The syrup is usually subtly infused with rose water and sometimes honey, but in lesser quantity – Persian baklava is generally less syrup-soaked and less sweet than its Arab or Ottoman cousins. It’s also sometimes cut into smaller diamond shapes or tiny squares, and you might find it garnished with crushed pistachios or dried rose petals for an elegant touch. The result is a more fragrant, delicate pastry that pairs wonderfully with Persian black tea. Other regions have their own twists as well. Armenian paklava, for instance, favors walnuts spiced with cinnamon and cloves, reflecting Armenian tastes for warm spices. Some Armenian recipes also add a splash of orange-blossom water in the syrup, bridging Middle Eastern and European flavors. In Cyprus, baklava might combine almonds and walnuts together. In parts of North Africa like Algeria, baklava is made with a pastry called malsouka (similar to phyllo) and often filled with almonds, with an orange-blossom-flavored syrup. No matter the variant, the essence of baklava endures, even as the details change from one kitchen to the next.

### Quick Comparison Table
| Region/Cuisine | Typical Nut Filling | Sweetener & Flavorings | Notable Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Turkish (Ottoman) | Pistachios (esp. Gaziantep) or walnuts; some regions use almonds or hazelnuts | Sugar syrup with water and lemon (no honey). Generally no added spices in filling. | Extremely thin hand-made phyllo (often 40+ layers). Very rich and moist, yet delicately crisp. Often served in small baklava squares or diamonds. |
| Greek | Walnuts (North) or almonds (South) are common, mixed with cinnamon | Honey-based syrup (honey + sugar, cinnamon, and citrus zest) | Often cut into larger squares or diamonds. Strong honey and cinnamon aroma. Traditionally 33 layers of phyllo for 33 years of Christ |
| Levantine (Arab) | Walnuts or pistachios (also cashews in some varieties), usually without additional spices in the nuts. | Sugar syrup (attar) lightened with rosewater or orange blossom water, sometimes a hint of lemon | Lighter and less sticky than others. Often cut in small diamond shapes or rolled into mini cigars. Delicate floral taste from syrup; popular during Ramadan and celebrations. |
| Persian (Iranian) | Almonds, pistachios, or a combination; often finely ground and sometimes includes cardamom | Light sugar syrup (sometimes with a little honey) infused with rosewater and saffron, plus a dash of cardamom | Tends to be drier and more delicately sweet. Often cut into small lozenge pieces. Fragrant with saffron and rose – an elegant, less sugary take on baklava. |
| Armenian | Walnuts spiced with cinnamon and cloves | Sugar syrup (sometimes with a touch of honey or citrus). | Typically cut in rhombus shapes. Aromatic and spiced flavor profile from the cinnamon/clove. Often served at holidays and weddings in Armenian communities. |

Each variation of baklava reflects the preferences of its creators – whether it’s the choice of nut (dictated by local crops) or the fragrance of the syrup (inspired by regional spices and flowers). Yet the similarities are undeniable. Everywhere, baklava is a labor of love: layers of dough painstakingly assembled, baked to golden perfection, and soaked in just the right amount of sweetness. It’s a testament to how a simple idea – “nuts, dough, sweetener” – can be adapted into a myriad of delightful forms across cultures.

## Baklava Today: A Timeless Dessert in the Modern World
Having journeyed through history, baklava today stands not only as a dessert but as a cultural emblem – especially for Turkey and the broader Middle East. The methods of making baklava have changed little from Ottoman times, and in many ways that’s a point of pride. Even in this age of automation, real baklava is still made by hand by skilled artisans. Masters of the craft train for years to roll and stretch the dough to gossamer thinness; as one baklava maker quips, “It’s truly a craft… not a process conducive to automation.” In traditional baklava bakeries in Turkey, teams of chefs work in unison, rolling out enormous sheets of phyllo (called yufka) so thin you can read a newspaper through them. Dozens of these whisper-thin layers are buttered and layered with nuts in large pans, cut meticulously into lozenges or squares, then baked. The final touch is a drenching in syrup – and in some places, technique matters here too (Gaziantep baklava makers insist on pouring the syrup hot over a hot pastry for the best texture). The result is the same magic every time: a tray of golden, glossy baklava, each piece glistening with syrup and beckoning to anyone with a sweet tooth. Baklava continues to be central to festive life. In Turkey and many Middle Eastern countries, baklava is a must-have sweet during Ramadan and is especially popular for Eid (the festival that ends Ramadan), when families celebrate with rich foods. It’s also commonly found at weddings, religious holidays like Christmas or Nowruz (Persian New Year), and other celebrations – a symbol of hospitality and joy. Because it’s usually made in large trays and then divided into many pieces, baklava is inherently a dessert for sharing with loved ones. From Istanbul to Athens to Beirut, people will tell you their grandmother or favorite bakery makes the best baklava – often sparking good-natured debates, as this dessert is a source of national pride in several countries. In fact, the origins of baklava have become a point of friendly contention between nations – notably between Greece and Turkey, where each claims it as their own. This culinary tug-of-war even made international news in 2013 when the European Union awarded a protected status designation to Gaziantep (Turkish) baklava, much to the dismay of some of Greece’s bakers. Around the same time, UNESCO recognized the tradition of making baklava in Gaziantep as part of Turkey’s intangible cultural heritage, solidifying what Turks have long believed: that baklava, in its finest form, is a jewel of Turkish cuisine. These recognitions don’t deny that baklava is truly a shared Middle Eastern and Mediterranean treat, but they do highlight Turkey’s deep historical and cultural role in shaping the modern baklava recipe. Today, baklava’s appeal is truly global. Once confined to the Old World, it’s now enjoyed from New York to New Delhi, and from Sydney to São Paulo. Immigrant communities have carried their baklava-making skills worldwide, so you can find excellent baklava in cities around the globe – whether at a Greek diner in Chicago or a Lebanese pastry shop in London. International food lovers have also embraced it; it’s not uncommon to see creative new spins, like chocolate-drizzled baklava or even baklava cheesecake, especially in Western fusion cuisine. Yet, it’s the classic recipe that endures and continues to win hearts. A famous century-old Turkish baklava bakery, Güllüoğlu, has opened dozens of branches worldwide (from Istanbul and Gaziantep to New York and Riyadh) to meet the growing demand – a testament to baklava’s universal popularity. Despite being exported and adapted, authentic baklava making remains an art that connects us to its storied past. Every time you crack into those crisp layers and taste that sweet, nutty filling, you are experiencing a dessert that has traveled through time and across cultures.
